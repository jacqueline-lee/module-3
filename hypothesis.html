       <p>This article makes a hard distinction between a recording and a live performance, so I'm curious how Gunkel considers "live" recordings and livestreamed concerts/events that later release the recorded version of the event.</p>

It's relevant because of the way it's put together. The Afiara Quartet approached Canadian composers and had them compose pieces for them. Skratch Bastid then took the recorded versions of those pieces and remixed them. They then sent the remixed versions back to the original composers, who then wrote a response to the remix for the Afiara Quartet to play with the remixed version. Every time they perform it it's a little bit different because Skratch Bastid mixes it live and thus it sounds different every time. It's definitely an interesting way to look at music, especially classical music. I think a lot of people have this idea of classical music being very stoic and unapproachable, but I find Spin Cycle is very open and easier to digest because it's very clearly a dialogue between the very classical form of the quartet speaking to the very modern concept of scratch DJ and remixing.  If anyone is interested, the pieces they play in the video are: 2 Pop Songs on Antique Poems: No. 2, I Will Not Let You Go, composed by Dinuk Wijeratne Soul Searching, Pts. 1 &amp; 2 (Skratch Bastid remix) Through the Invisible, composed by Dinuk Wijeratne [this is the piece Wijeratne composed in response to the remix]  I have a physical copy of the album, and it's also on Spotify if that's an app you use.
